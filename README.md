The programs explore two distinct yet fundamental scheduling paradigms. The first code focuses on First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and Round-Robin (RR) algorithms to manage tasks in a linked-list data structure, emphasizing fairness in time-sharing through time quantum allocation. Metrics such as completion time, waiting time, and turnaround time are calculated and presented in detailed tabular formats, demonstrating how these algorithms manage task sequencing and resource allocation.

The second code implements a Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler using multiple priority-based queues. Tasks dynamically adjust their execution levels based on their remaining burst time and time quantum, reflecting real-world multitasking and priority balancing. This program showcases progressive demotion of tasks for fairness and efficient resource utilization, with comprehensive results displayed post-scheduling.

Together, these codes provide a practical demonstration of task scheduling techniques, highlighting the trade-offs between simplicity, fairness, and efficiency in system operations. Their implementation serves as a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of scheduling strategies in computing environments.
